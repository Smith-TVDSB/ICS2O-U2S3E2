# 2-2 Exercise 3

## The assignment
Edit the file named "student.py".  
You should only use one print statement, otherwise use the input statement for user instructions.  
  
Ask the user to enter a name and output  “This name is in the first half of the alphabet” if the name entered starts with ‘M’ or a letter that comes before M.  
Or it outputs “This name is in the last half of the alphabet if it starts with N or later.  
Make sure to test is with a name like Maurice, Mary, Mick, Mohammed, or Mzzzz. All of these names are considered the first part of the alhpabet.  
  
Assume the first letter is a capital 'M' since it's a name.
